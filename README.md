To-Do List Application
This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them from the list.

Features
Add tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing them into the input field and pressing enter.
Mark tasks as complete: Completed tasks can be marked by clicking on the checkbox beside each task.
Remove tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking on the delete button associated with each task.
Save tasks: Tasks are saved locally in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Once added, you can mark tasks as complete by clicking on the checkbox, or remove them by clicking on the delete button.
